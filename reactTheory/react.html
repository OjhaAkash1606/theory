        What is React js?
        <ol>
          <li>
            React is a library of javascript.
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
              <li>
                Differences between library and framworks.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    In library function or code is invoked by programmers but in
                    framework function or code is invoked by itself.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Library is not a software but framework is a software.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Why learn react?
        <ol>
          <li>
            React builds UI(user interface) as fast as possible because it uses
            virtual dom at place of real dom each time.
          </li>
          <li>React is used to single page application.</li>
          <li>
            React is a long term product because it is maintained by facebook.
          </li>
          <li>ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components.</li>
          <li>Large community for your support.</li>
          <li>Mobile app devlopment with react-native.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is class and function component?
        <ol>
          <li>
            Class Component
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
              <li>We can not used hooks in Class Component.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Function Component
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>JSX stands for JavaScript XML.</li>
      <li>JSX allows us to write HTML in React(also in JS).</li>
      <li>JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.</li>
      <li>
        JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the
        DOM without any createElement()
        <br />
        and/or appendChild() methods.
      </li>
      <li>JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.</li>
      <li>
        Inserting a Large Block of HTML <br />
        To write HTML on multiple lines, put the HTML inside parentheseslike
        this().
      </li>
      <li>
        JSX follows XML rules, and therefore HTML elements must be properly
        closed. <br />
        JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not properly closed.<br />
        Close empty elements with />
      </li>
      <li>
        The HTML code must be wrapped in ONE top level element. <br />
        So if you like to write two headers, you must put them inside a parent
        element, like a div element <br />
        JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not correct, or if the HTML
        misses a parent element.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>State is Public or private in react?</li>
      <br />
      <li>state can be used out side of component in react or not ?</li>

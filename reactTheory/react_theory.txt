What are pros and cons of React JS?
    -pros
        -React JS improves application performance due to virtual dom.
            (when we write a React component, we did not write directly to the DOM. Instead, we are writing virtual components that react will turn into the DOM, leading to smoother and faster performance.)

        -In React improves code readibility with the help of JSX.
            (In JSX, we can write html and javascript together.)

        -React builds single page application.

    -Cons
        -React is a library not a full-blown framework.
            (React focused only on UI not on development so we need to choose other technology to developed a project)
        
        -React has poor documentation due to constantly updating technology.
            (React technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation.)
